# Fourier Series Visualization

This is a fourier series visualization, you can use the up and down arrow to increase/decrease the cicles used. For more information about the Fourier series check resources bellow.

This project was made using [SFML.Net](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net) and .Net Core 5.

The input function used was 4sin(N\*θ)/N\*π.

## Dependencies

You need the [dotnet cli](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to install the dependencies.

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Run

To run the project you can refer to the ./dist folder for release files and run from the .exe, or you can recompile the project using:
```bash
dotnet build
